# Spam Detection Project

## Abstract

Email spam has become a major problem nowadays. With the rapid growth of internet users, email spam is also increasing. People use them for illegal and unethical conduct, phishing, and fraud. Sending malicious links through spam emails can harm our systems and infiltrate them. Creating a fake profile and email account is easy for spammers, who pretend to be genuine people in their spam emails. These spammers target those who are not aware of these frauds. Therefore, it is necessary to identify those spam emails which are fraudulent. This project will identify spam using machine learning techniques. It will discuss machine learning algorithms, apply them to our datasets, and select the best algorithm for email spam detection based on precision and accuracy.
